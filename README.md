# Ubuntu change login background on GDM3

Uses built in commands to change the GDM login screen wallpaper on Ubuntu 24.04, without modifying CSS files or resources directly. I think this may work with Ubuntu 22.04 as well. 

These are the sample files for my blog post on [Syncing the login wallpaper with the desktop wallpaper on Ubuntu](https://code.mendhak.com/synchronize-login-wallpaper-ubuntu/).
